R E A D  M E

This beta additionally requires Hybrid Crop Engine, Content Patcher, and Producer Framework Mod. Included in this ReadMe are my notes on hybrid crops (produced by HCE) and other notes about the mod.



H Y B R I D  N O T E S

Fruity Pebbles OG -> Green Ribbon/Granddaddy Purple/Tahoe Alien (Requires the seed maker)

Granddaddy Purple -> Purple Urkle/Big Bud
Purple Urkle -> Mendocino Purps

Green Ribbon -> Green Crack/Trainwreck/Afghanica/White Rhino (Requires the seed maker)
White Rhino -> White Widow

Tahoe Alien -> Tahoe OG Kush/Alien Kush
Alien Kush -> LVPK/Alien Dawg

LVPK -> Hindu Kush/Purple Afghani
Alien Dawg -> Chemdawg/Alien Technology

Chemdawg -> Sour Diesel/OG Kush

Hybrid Crop Engine only can produce a hybrid from 2 crops which is why for some objects you'll have to put them into the seed maker. That's the PFM component. 



A U T H O R  N O T E S

- Currently many crops & objects have the same json that's copy pasted. I dislike balancing these types of mods so feedback is welcome. This will be changed in the final release but for now what matters is they are functional.

- I have done my best to portray these strains as closely to their real world counterparts as possible. However many strains look similar so some may be identical/near identical.

- Hybridization is a complex process. Many strains are made from hybrids. I have picked some strains to use for this process and would like to expand upon it further but for now you can only create 10 strains from inputting two strains into a seedmaker.

- I don't know much about weed. If something is wrong feel free to send a PR with a correction or suggestions on what to add.

- Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid were crops in taintedwheat's mod rather than classifications. Since this mod has been expanded to include 26 new strains these assets have been recycled into other strains and Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid removed. Some descriptions include what type they are but this has no effect on what you can/cannot do with them. If you have ideas feel free to suggest them on Github.

- Shatter has been moved to the grinder. This is to hopefully put another bandaid on until changes are made to PFM to allow context_tags in FuelIdentifier. If there is a better machine feel free to suggest.
